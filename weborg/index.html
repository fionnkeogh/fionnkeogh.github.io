                <p>In order to tackle the problem of calculating chemical organizations, the web tool OrgWeb is presented in this thesis to tie in with the work of the offline tool OrgTools. The presentation of the tool includes not only the algorithm used, but also deals with the libraries used and the user interface.
                The implemented algorithm used is based on the Constructive Algorithm. The Constructive Algorithm is one of currently two known fully computational algo- rithms. The heuristics are not discussed here.
                OrgWeb is a good alternative to OrgTools. The lack of complicated installation is a big advantage over OrgTools. This could lead to a broader application of chemical organization theory.</p><br>
